## Research Group Spectral Analysis - Paderborn University

This is the main GitHub page of the mathematical research group *spectral analysis* located at Paderborn University. Our research covers a wide variety of analytical topics coming from

- spectral geometry,
- the theory of dynamical systems,
- mathematical physics,
- representation theory,
- and many more!

A common theme is the usage of **microlocal methods** as the central tool in our investigations.

Furthermore we are interested in the general numerical investigation of dynamical systems and partial differential equations, and more concretely in (dynamical) zeta functions as a means of understanding Ruelle resonances for various types of systems. If you would like to collaborate on a numerical project feel free to contact us any time!

Additional information regarding recent publications, events, open positions, etc. can be found on [our homepage](https://math.uni-paderborn.de/ag/arbeitsgruppe-spektralanalysis/).

At the moment we are looking for a student researcher for a numerical project regarding complex analysis and in particular the argument principle. This project would also be suitable for either a **Bachelor's or Master's thesis**. If you are interested just send us an email!
