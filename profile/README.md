**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

This is the main GitHub page of the mathematical research group *spectral analysis* located at Paderborn University. Our research covers a wide variety of analytical topics coming from

- spectral geometry
- the theory of dynamical systems
- mathematical physics,
- representation theory

A common theme is the usage of microlocal methods as the central tool in our investigations.

Furthermore we are interested in the general numerical investigation of dynamical systems and partial differential equations, mostly via (dynamical) zeta functions as a means of understanding Ruelle resonances. If you would like to collaborate on a numerical project feel free to contact us any time!

Additional information regarding recent publications, events, open positions, etc. can be found at [our homepage](https://math.uni-paderborn.de/ag/arbeitsgruppe-spektralanalysis/).

At the moment we are looking for a student researcher for a numerical project regarding complex analysis and in particular the argument principle. This project would also be suitable for either a **Bachelor's or Master's thesis**.
